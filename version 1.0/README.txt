Waterloo DC ++

By: Thomas Millar

Version: 1.0

This is a second iteration of the Waterloo DC ++ install script.  Originally this was just a script that can be downloaded and ran that would automatically download, install, and configure ShakesPeer (A Direct Connect client) to be used with The University of Waterloo's Direct Connect network.  This iteration is a lot more user friendly in that it doesn't show a terminal window, but rather a nice installer.  I will probably only be updating this installer once more for aesthetic reasons unless there are bugs. Enjoy! 

Usage:
	1/	Download the project
	2/	Open the downloaded folder
	3/	Double-Click the installDC++.command file.
	4/	Follow the onscreen steps, enter password when required.
	
Developer Setup
	NOTE: The installer was created and configured with the Packages application which can be found here (http://s.sudre.free.fr/Software/Packages/about.html). The specific installer panes I created myself in XCode. There are two aliases in the project folder. Obviously those won't work, it was just there to easily link to the bundles of the custom installer pane.
